The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the use of the U-Blade (RC) lag screw is associated with reduced cut-out in patients with OTA\/AO 31A1-3 fractures.MATERIAL &\\nBetween 2009 and 2014, 751 patients with OTA\/AO 31A1-3 fractures were treated with a Gamma3®nail at our institution. Out of this sample 199 patients were treated with U-blade (RC) lag screws. A total of 135 patients (117 female, 18 male) with standard lag screw (treatment group A) were matched equally regarding age (±4 years) sex, fracture type and location to 135 patients with U-blade (RC) lag screw (treatment group B). Within a mean follow up of 9.2 months (range 6-18 months) we assessed the cut-out rate, the calTAD, lag screw migration, the Parker's mobility score and the Parker's ratio at postoperatively, six and 12 months following surgery. Furthermore we recorded all complications, ASA-Score, hospital stay and duration of surgery retrospectively.\\nThe most common fracture among group B with a cut-out of the lag screw were AO\/OTA 2.3 and 3.2 fractures whereas in group A cut-out was most commonly seen in AO\/OTA 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 fractures, there was no significant reduction of the cut-out rate in group B 2.2% (n=3) compared to group A 3.7% (n=5). The duration of surgery was significantly shorter in group A (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in lag screw placement, the Parker's ratio and mobilization.\"]\n\nUser Question: Does an additional antirotation U-Blade (RC) lag screw improve treatment of AO\/OTA 31 A1-3 fractures with gamma 3 nail?",

Clinical characteristics; echocardiographic right ventricular dysfunction; inhospital mortality; and adverse clinical events including need for inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, and thrombolysis were compared in patients with elevated cTnI levels vs patients with normal cTnI levels.

Even today, activities around the olive tree constitute major engagements of several people in the countryside of both sides of the Mediterranean basin. The olive fly is, beyond doubt, the most destructive pest of cultivated olives. The female fly leaves its eggs in the olive fruit. Upon emergence, the larvae feed on the olive sap, thus destroying the fruit. If untreated, practically all olives get infected. The use of chemical insecticides constitutes the principal olive fly control approach. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), an environmentally friendly alternative control method, had been tried in pilot field applications in the 1970's, albeit with no practical success. This was mainly attributed to the low, non-antagonistic quality of the mixed-sex released insects. Many years of experience from successful SIT applications in related species, primarily the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, demonstrated that efficient SIT protocols require the availability of fundamental genetic and molecular information.\nAmong the primary systems whose understanding can contribute towards novel SIT approaches (or its recently developed alternative RIDL: Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal) is the reproductive, since the ability to manipulate the reproductive system would directly affect the insect's fertility. In addition, the analysis of early embryonic promoters and apoptotic genes would provide tools that confer dominant early-embryonic lethality during mass-rearing. Here we report the identification of several genes involved in these systems through whole transcriptome analysis of female accessory glands (FAGs) and spermathecae, as well as male testes.

TCN was defined as death, Injury Severity Score (ISS) of greater than 15, emergency department transfusion, intensive care unit admission, need for laparotomy\/thoracotomy\/vascular surgery within 24 hours of arrival, pelvic fracture, 2 or more proximal long bone fractures, or neurosurgical intervention during admission. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify which MOI predict TCN.\\nA total of 3,569 patients were transported to our trauma center who met only MOI criteria and had the MOI recorded in the registry; 821 MOI patients (23%) were identified who met our definition of TCN. Significant predictors of TCN included death in the same passenger compartment, ejection from vehicle, extrication time of more than 20 minutes, fall from more than 20 feet, and pedestrian thrown\/runover. Criteria not meeting TCN include vehicle intrusion, rollover motor vehicle collision, speed of more than 40 mph, injury from autopedestrian\/autobicycle of more than 5 mph, and both of the motorcycle crash (MCC) criteria.\"]\n\nUser Question: Are not all mechanisms created equal : a single-center experience with the national guidelines for field triage of injured patients?",

Finally, we determined the effect of pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity on the LPS stimulation-dependent induction of Il1β and Tnf mRNA.\\nOur results indicate that LPS stimulation induces PARP1 enzymatic activity and histone ADP-ribosylation in the chromatin compartment of BV2 cells. In vitro studies show that nucleosome-bound PARP1 disrupts nucleosome structure histone ADP-ribosylation, increasing the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA. Consistent with this PARP1 is constitutively associated with at the Il1β and Tnf promoters in resting BV2 cells. Upon stimulation with LPS, ADP-ribosylation is observed at these promoters, and this is correlated with increased recruitment of the transcription factor NF-κB, resulting in robust transcription of these inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity reduces NF-κB recruitment, and Il1β and Tnf expression in LPS-stimulated microglia.']\n\nUser Question: Does pARP1 enhance inflammatory cytokine expression by alteration of promoter chromatin structure in microglia?",

The function of miR-18a in regulating HIF1A expression, as well as cellular responses to hypoxia and metastasis, were then studied in vitro and in vivo by assessing ectopic miR-18a expression or miR-18a inhibition. miRNA-mRNA interactions (AGO2 immunoprecipitation and 3' untranslated region Luciferase reporter assays), gene expression (quantitative PCR and microarray), cell migration and invasion, and cell growth were assessed under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, complemented by orthotopic xenograft of tumor cells to the mammary fat pad to investigate the effect of modulating miR-18a expression on primary tumor growth and lung metastasis. Last, clinically relevant correlations between miR-18a, HIF1A, hypoxia-responsive gene expression and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were assessed using published expression array breast tumors data sets.\\nmiRNAs encoded by the MIR17HG gene were downregulated in lung metastases compared to primary tumors. Ectopic expression of miR-18a, a MIR17HG family member, in a metastatic variant of MDA-MB-231 cells reduced primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, whereas miR-18a inhibition in the parental cells promoted tumor growth and lung metastasis. We identified HIF1A as a direct target of miR-18a. Modulating miR-18a expression significantly affected hypoxic gene expression, cell invasiveness and sensitivity to anoikis and hypoxia in vitro in a HIF1A-dependent manner. Analysis of previously published data revealed that higher expression of HIF1A and a panel of hypoxic genes is associated with shorter DMFS interval in patients with basal-like breast tumors, and that, within this subtype, miR-18a expression is inversely correlated with hypoxic gene expression. Together, these data support a role of miR-18a in repressing distant metastasis through a HIF1A-dependent pathway.\"]\n\nUser Question: Does microRNA-18a inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor 1α activity and lung metastasis in basal breast cancers?",

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effect of a TLR2 agonist on neonatal brain development.\\nMice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) once a day from postnatal day (PND) 3 to PND11 with endotoxin-free saline, a TLR2 agonist Pam(3)CSK(4) (5 mg\/kg) or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.3 mg\/kg). Pups were sacrificed at PND12 or PND53 and brain, spleen and liver were collected and weighed. Brain sections were stained for brain injury markers. Long-term effects on memory function were assessed using the Trace Fear Conditioning test at PND50. After 9 days of Pam(3)CSK(4) administration, we found a decreased volume of cerebral gray matter, white matter in the forebrain and cerebellar molecular layer that was accompanied by an increase in spleen and liver weight at PND12. Such effects were not observed in Pam3CSK4-treated TLR 2-deficient mice. Pam3CSK4-treated mice also displayed decreased hippocampus neuronal density, and increased cerebral microglia density, while there was no effect on caspase-3 or general cell proliferation at PND12. Significantly elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-6, KC, and MCP-1 were detected after the first Pam3CSK4 injection in brain homogenates of PND3 mice. Pam(3)CSK(4) administration did not affect long-term memory function nor the volume of gray or white matter.']\n\nUser Question: Does systemic stimulation of TLR2 impair neonatal mouse brain development?",
